    <div class="about">
        <p>Hey, I'm Jack, and this is my website (although that's pretty obvious). I'm currently a <b>Game Design and Development</b> student based in <b>Newcastle</b>, with the intention on studying <b>Games Programming</b> at <b>Teeside University.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>Games in general have been a long time love of mine, but while I <i>do</i> love the creative side (bar anything artistic, I just don't have the eye for it), coding has been my true calling for as long as I can remember. I've spent time learning web languages such as <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, while my latter school years were dedicated to <b>Python</b>. I'm currently in the process of teaching myself <b>C++</b> in order to more away from Unreal Engine's <b>Blueprints</b> (no matter how satisfying they are to look at when done neatly).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Other than games, I like reading manga and watching the occasional anime. I <i>do</i> like going for walks, even if I don't go on them as often as I should. I watch far too much YouTube the I often struggle to find anything to watch on it now. Depending on how I'm feeling, I sometimes stream now and people laugh at me die in Elden Ring.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This website serves as a place of many things: a review board for the latest games I've played or media I've watched; a place I can post a blog when I actually do something intersting for once (trust me, it's happening more often!); but most importantly, a place for my portfolio, where I can show off all the work I am proud of completing, or at least starting on, either solo or with friends.</p>

    <h1>Sadly, this website is still under development, so please wait a bit longer.</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center">But hey, you at least got to learn a bit about me right?</p>
